\arguments{
\item{basename}{the name of the etopo geotiff (without file extension).}

\item{path}{the path to a folder containing the etopo geotiff}

\value{
a logical indicating whether the point is land or sea.

\description{
A land mask based on the full ETOPO1 dataset
}
\details{
Generate a land mask function based on ETOPO1 topography. The
etopo geotiff is not bundled with the package and must be
downloaded from
\url{https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html}.

When the mask is intially created, a native raster (grd, gri)
version of the geotiff is created in the directory \code{tmp},
which must be writable. This file can be deleted when the
computation is finished.

The \code{land} argument determines whether the mask function
returns \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} for land. The mask is constant
and the \code{tm} argument to the mask is ignored.
